This is a WIP for a simple puzzle game made in Pico8. Inspired by Gauss Jordan elimination. 

- Pressing Z will change the colors of the selected row.

- Pressing right, will allow you to swap the selected row into another position.

- Pressing left, will duplicate the selected row to allow you merging it with another row. You can press Z to change the colors of the duplicated row as well.
