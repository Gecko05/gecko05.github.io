# Explaining Bytes

While writing the next post for my Blue computer, I noticed that I could write
a bunch of stuff explaining really basic concepts needed to understand more about
computers. Things that I could talk to my friends in short conversations to introduce
them to concepts of digital electronics through analogies that are intuitive and simple to digest.

In this first post we'll go over bits and bytes, and the other derived terms that 
we use when talking about memory storage for computers, like kiloBytes, megaBytes, etc.

## From the ground up

Before talking about Bytes, let's talk about bits. Bits are simply a bunch of 1's and 0's inside a computer.
In other words, there are only two forms a bit can take, it's either 1 or 0, turned on or turned off, black or white,
up or down. It is a data type that we can use to represent something that has only two possible states, for example, 
the light in your room, it's either on or off, there's no in between if you use an on-off switch. Anything that can 
only have two states can be represented with an all mighty bit.
