I"ô<p>Two months ago I got a new 128x128 OLED Display to play with, this time it was the <strong>SSD1351</strong>. This OLED display, although limited, supports RGB colors which has been very exciting as itâ€™s my first time working with one of those. I got this display from <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.Xssd1351.TRS0&amp;_nkw=ssd1351&amp;_sacat=0">ebay</a> for around $17, a relatively cheap price if we consider its potential.</p>
