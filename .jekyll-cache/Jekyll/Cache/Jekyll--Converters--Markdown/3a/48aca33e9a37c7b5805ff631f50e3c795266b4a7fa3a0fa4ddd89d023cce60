<p>This is a simple puzzle game made in Pico8. Inspired by Gauss Jordan elimination. My objective was to reflect the “intuitive” feeling of solving systems of equations using the GJ elimination method in a simpler and more fun way. I’m not sure how fun it is though, to be honest I don’t play it much.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pressing Z will change the colors of the selected row.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressing right, will allow you to swap the selected row into another position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressing left, will duplicate the selected row to allow you merging it with another row. You can press Z to change the colors of the duplicated row as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
