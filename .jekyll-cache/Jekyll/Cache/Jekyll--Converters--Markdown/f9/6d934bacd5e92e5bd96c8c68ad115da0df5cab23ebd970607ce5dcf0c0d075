The things I felt when I made my first international trip was excitement, loneliness and cold.
</p><p>
Last December I made my first trip ever to a new country: Poland. This was also my first time taking a flight and my first time taking vacations after I started working for the industry. You might thinkg it wasn't the best idea to go on winter vacations alone to such a cold place, let alone if you come from a warm place like Mexico (Although winter can be pretty cold here as well). And it might be true, from a "fun" perspective, it would have been a better idea to go to a sunny place like the beach, or maybe a more touristic location. Instead I decided to go alone to the city of Poznan, capital of the Greater Poland.</p></div>
