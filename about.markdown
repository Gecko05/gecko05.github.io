Welcome! I created this site to share a few thoughts about things I like to do on my free time. I try hard not to overwork myself, but it's just so difficult to resist typing in words over the weekends and writing things from scratch!

The main topics you'll see me cover are low level programming and things related to game development.
I like playing with technical information and trying to come up with abstract concepts and analogies to better explain the big picture of what's being presented.

Feel free to contact me if you have any comments on any of the posts or ideas to work on.

This site was made with Jekyll
