The things I felt when I made my first international trip was excitement, loneliness and cold.
</p><p>
Last December I made my first trip ever to a new country: Poland. This was also my first time taking a flight and my first time taking vacations after I started working for the industry. You might thinkg it wasn't the best idea to go on winter vacations alone to such a cold place, let alone if you come from a warm place like Mexico (Although winter can be pretty cold here as well). And it might be true, from a "comfortable" perspective, it would have been a better idea to go to a sunny place like the beach, or maybe a more touristic location. Instead I decided to go alone to the city of Poznan, capital of the Greater Poland.</p></div>

<h2 id="why-poland">Why Poland?</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>
This is the first question I got from almost every Pole I've talked with: "Why Poland?". This broke my heart a bit, as I felt Poles were implying that their country is neither a beautiful nor an interesting place to visit compared to the rest of the world. Of course this is not true, and although many Poles love their country, to my perception, it's bit of a hidden place in terms of tourism.</p> </div>

<p><img src="/assets/images/colorPoznan.jpeg" alt="SSD1351" class="img-responsive" width="400px" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>
As a nerd, my first interest in Poland sparked since I started playing The Witcher games. I was amazed at how different the first game felt compared to your average fantasy roleplaying-game. Sure it's still some kind of Tolkien-ish fantasy, however, the monsters, the story, and the whole mood of the game felt like a breath of fresh air. I had to discover where did this come from.</p>

<p>After getting to know how was the game developed, and a bit about the history of Poland, I became engaged to getting to know this place even better. I started planning on visiting this country on my first vacations, which would be around holidays so I could stay ther as long as I could without quitting my job or something. It took me a year of waiting, a time during I started learning the language. Although the words in Polish can look intimidating; like "chrząszcz", it's a rather easy language to pronounce for someone from Mexico, since most of the consonats have equivalent sounds in spanish. After almost a year of self study and some months aided by a Polish teacher, I was able to make simple and slow conversations, nothing too fancy, but something that would help me get out of trouble.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/witcher.jpeg" alt="SSD1351" class="img-responsive" width="400px" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>If I were to repeat this trip with my current level of Polish language, I would feel more afraid than I felt before. In my imagination I overestimated my Polish proficiency, thinking that I would be able to understand every single word that came out from native speakers or people on the streets.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-the-winter">Getting to know the winter</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>As someone from a tropical birthplace, I had never really experienced a typical movie-like winter season, the ones where the trees die, the clouds are always covering the sun, and the cold can kill you if you don't wear the appropiate clothes.</p>

<p>So, after almost 20 hours of traveling, I finally arrived to Poland. The first time I heard polish I felt happy, as if I was at home. I had been hearing people talking in german for about 18 hours, and I don't know german at all. However, as I started hearing this first polish conversation, some kind of fear also started growing on me since I only understood around 20% of what people were saying. I instantly knew I could have some trouble using a service, asking for food, or just trying to chat with Poles. </p>
</div>
<p><img src="/assets/images/walk.jpeg" alt="SSD1351" class="img-responsive" width="400px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>When I arrived to Poznan airport, I saw this grey cold winter weather I've never seen before. It was something exciting, yet also daunting. Everything was new to me, and I felt like I was a child who got lost. Also, the airport was lonely, and a bit dark since not all the lights were turned on. No familiar faces, no native languages, everyone was tall and white. So then a concerning thought crossed my mind: "Where the heck did I come to?".</p>

<p>I could have been more comfortable going to almost anywhere in Mexico, and even more comfortable if I just stayed at home playing games from my bed all day long. I knew I wasn't going to feel comfortable, but I wasn't sure what to expect either.</p>

<p>So then I went and stayed at a hostel, expecting to make new friends who would share with me a lot of interesting stories about how they travel around the world and what they like about Poland. Yeah, I was wrong. For the most part I stayed alone in a bedroom for six people. The first night was so cold, and I had no idea how warmers worked so I didn't bother to turn them on (Yeah, I can be that stupid). That first night I met an Ukrainian guy, and we talked for a while. He was on his way to Ukraine to visit his family for New Year's Eve.</p></div>

<p><img src="/assets/images/zamek.jpeg" alt="SSD1351" class="img-responsive" width="400px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>The next day, jetlag hit me pretty hard and amplified my anxiety, I didn't have the energy to get up from bed and start walking around the city. The sun set around 4pm and it was too cold outside, so I felt like sleeping a lot the first three days of my vacations. Also I had this weird feeling about being "no one" outside of Mexico, as if my enviroment dictated who I am.</p>

<p>At the hostel, I also met a Peruvian guy that just moved from Spain to Poland and enjoyed to spend his free nights at Poznan, and an old Polish man who tried to flirt with me, LOL.</p>

<p>Then I moved out of the hostel and stayed at an hotel for the rest of my vacations. On the way to the hotel I felt a bit misserable, I felt like I was wasting my vacations, in the same fashion as I felt about wasting my free time in Mexico. I was pretty much on bed all day long, going out to get to know the old town just ocassionally. I missed my family, my friends and being in a place where I would have no trouble communicating. </p>
</div>

<h2 id="i-was-carrying-the-sunny-weather-with-me-all-the-time">I was carrying the sunny weather with me all the time</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>At the hotel I got used to the schedule change and things started to look brighter for me. This time the breakfast was nice, I felt more privacy, practiced talking Polish with people, and I got to know the city better. I also met a guy from Mexico who was also on vacations, he was visiting his sister who already lived in Poland. This helped me a lot since we went out to eat some delicious pierogi, meet a Polish friend of his, and I got to talk plenty of Spanish. Also, in the next days I would meet for the first time with my best Polish friend with whom I had been talking for almost a year now. This is the time when my anxiety levels started to drop and something clicked on my head; I'm just the same old me, and maybe even a more interesting and well-rested version of me in Poland. Wherever I get to go, I don't depend on my surroundings to define who I am.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>During my stay I got to know even more of the city, like several plazas, some parks, churches, a lovely neighborhood next to an island surrounded by two rivers. All of this would eventually lead to me getting used to Poznan and having the best time I've had in almost two years or so. I must say Poznan is a beautiful city, so much different than Mexico, and I kind of fell in love with it even if I was in such a grey season. Poznan has big old buildings full of history, wide roadwalks, bycicle roads, a lot of trees, great parks, two beautiful wide rivers, amazing churches, and way more things to discover that I didn't get to know.</p>

<p>The people is also nice and hospitable, although from a western perspective they're often described as cold, which is unfair since they're still gentle people and really warm as anyone else once you get to know them better. As an introvert, this was no problem for me, however, I can understand how extroverts would need a bit more of excitement from social interactions.</p></div>

<p><img src="/assets/images/island.jpeg" alt="SSD1351" class="img-responsive" width="400px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>I was starting to feel at home, and sadly I had to go back to Mexico soon. I said goodbye and came back to my dear country after almost 15 days of vacations. Neither my back, nor my neck hurted, I had rested well and I kind of forgot how stressed and anxious I would feel on a daily basis. After all, even if I had a bit of a hard time on winter, I miss Poland, and I threaten to go back and get to know the rest of the cities I couldn't visit like Cracow, Wroclaw, Zakopane and Warsaw. Poland has something special that feels really personal to me. However, I think I would go back on a sunnier weather to be able to stay longer on the outside and see all the beautiful natural landscapes Poland has to offer.</p>

<p>I do recommend visiting Poland, especially when it's not winter. However, I need to advice you to get to know a bit of the language before going. Athough most people talk english very well, some others don't, especially if it's the older generation. Also, if it's your first time travelling, be prepared to experience some new feelings, both good and bad. But remember that at the end everything will be Ok, as humans, we can adapt to social change and eventually grow from it.</p>
